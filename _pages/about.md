At the Center for Astrophysical Research (CRAL) of ENS Lyon, I investigate the earliest stages of star and planet formation through high-performance computational astrophysics. By carrying out high-resolution simulations that self-consistently model gravity, radiation transport, and magnetic fields, I study the physical processes governing the formation and evolution of protostars and circumstellar disks. My research specifically targets the critical inner region (sub-AU scales) to understand the initial conditions for star and planet formation, as well as the dynamics of the star-disk connection.

My research directly addresses several long-standing challenges in astrophysics, including the angular momentum problem, the magnetic flux problem, the luminosity problem, and the disk mass problem. My work also extends to planetology, in which I offer insights on the transport of high-temperature condensates in the early solar syste, thus allowing us to better interpret the composition of meteorites. My simulations incorporate advanced numerical techniques and leverage high-performance computing to achieve unprecedented fidelity in modeling these complex and highly non-linear astrophysical processes.
