At the Center for Astrophysical Research (CRAL) of ENS Lyon, I investigate the earliest stages of star and planet formation through high-performance computational astrophysics. By carrying out high-resolution simulations that self-consistently model gravity, radiation transport, and magnetic fields, I study the physical processes governing the formation and evolution of protostars and circumstellar disks. My research specifically targets the critical inner region (sub-AU scales) to understand the initial conditions for star and planet formation, as well as the dynamics of the star-disk connection.
