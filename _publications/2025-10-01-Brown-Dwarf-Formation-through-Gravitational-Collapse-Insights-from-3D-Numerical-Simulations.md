The formation mechanism of Brown Dwarfs (BDs), whether akin to stars or ejected planetary-mass objects, remains debated. We present the first 3D radiation-MHD simulations of magnetized, turbulent, gravitationally unstable low-mass cores $$(0.05-0.1\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}})$$ collapsing into proto-BDs. Using the $$\texttt{RAMSES}$$ code with adaptive mesh refinement, we model the full dynamical range $$(10^{5}~-10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}})$$, including radiative transfer (flux limited diffusion) and non-ideal MHD (ambipolar diffusion). Our simulations self-consistently follow the isothermal collapse, first hydrostatic core formation, H$_{2}$ dissociation, and BD birth. The resulting BDs have initial radii $$\approx 0.75\ \mathrm{R_{\odot}}$$ and masses $$\approx 0.8\ \mathrm{M_{Jup}}$$, growing via accretion as we follow the early evolution of the object. Crucially, we find that BDs may form similarly to low-mass stars but with a prolonged first-core phase, supporting a star-like formation scenario.
